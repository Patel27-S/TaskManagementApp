## TaskManagementApp

An App helps users add tasks they have to complete, keep track of them, delete them as completed.
Eventually, the app would send the list of number and titles of incompleted tasks to the user via email by the end of day.

This is an interesting project for me. It had to be stopped to be worked upon due to my semester workload. But, I will soon resume it when I find some time to get going with it.
